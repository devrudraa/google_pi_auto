# What is it

So one day I was searching for the value of PI on google and I got to know that there is a game that you can play it is based on PI in the google calculator 
[Try It](https://www.google.com/search?q=value+of+pi&oq=value+of+pi)

So I thought to make it automatic/make a bot that plays this game.

## What I used
I used **Python** and **Selenium** to make this bot and it was a fun experience

## How to use
I was trying to make it in **Ubuntu** but I don't know why *selenium* does not work for me in *Ubuntu*.

So I switched to **Windows** and that works perfectly fine there.

You can download my source code and run it it will work perfectly fine (AT LEAST IT WORKED FOR ME)
